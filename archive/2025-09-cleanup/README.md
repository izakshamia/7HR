# Archived Files (2025-09-16)

This directory contains files and directories that were identified as unused or irrelevant to the core application logic as of 2025-09-16.

The archived items include:
- **Supabase-related files:** A full implementation for interacting with Supabase, which appears to have been replaced by a direct PostgreSQL connection using `psycopg2`.
- **Vercel-deployment files:** Configuration and wrappers for deploying the application on the Vercel platform.
- **One-off scripts:** Utility and maintenance scripts that are not part of the core application logic.

These files have been archived to clean up the project structure. They can be reviewed or restored if needed.
